      <dd>
        Web design is the process of creating and designing websites. It
        involves a combination of aesthetic principles, usability
        considerations, and technical elements to achieve a visually appealing
        and functional website. Key aspects of web design include layout, color
        scheme, typography, graphics, and user experience (UX) design.
      </dd>
      <dt id="Webdevelopment"><b>Web Development</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Web development encompasses the broader process of building and
        maintaining websites. It involves both the front-end (client-side) and
        back-end (server-side) aspects of creating a website, as well as
        database management and server configuration.
      </dd>
      <dt id="FrontendDevelopment"><b>Frontend Development</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Front-end development is the process of creating the visual and
        interactive parts of a website that users directly interact with. It's a
        combination of design, technology, and programming that uses markup
        languages and other tools to create a user interface.
      </dd>
      <dt id="BackendDevelopment"><b>Backend Development</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Backend development is the server-side aspect of web development that
        focuses on the parts of a website that aren't visible to the user.
        Backend developers ensure that websites function properly by working on
        databases, application programming interfaces (APIs), architecture,
        back-end logic, and servers.
      </dd>
      <dt id="CyberSecurity"><b>Cyber Security</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and
        programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at
        accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting
        money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business
        processes
      </dd>
      <dt id="DataAnalysis"><b>Data Analysis</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Data analysis is the process of cleaning, analyzing, interpreting, and
        visualizing data using various techniques and business intelligence
        tools. Data analysis tools help you discover relevant insights that lead
        to smarter and more effective decision-making.
      </dd>
      <dt id="FullstackDevelopment"><b>FullStack Development</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Full stack development is the process of building both the front-end and
        back-end of an application. The front-end is the user-facing part of the
        application, including the user interface and code for user
        interactions. The back-end handles the application's logic and
        workflows, which run behind the scenes, such as server-side software and
        databases.
      </dd>
      <dt id="PythonProgramming"><b>Python Programming</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for
        build control and management, testing, and in many other ways. SCons for
        build control. Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous
        compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project
        management.
      </dd>
      <dt id="GeneralComputer"><b>General Computer</b></dt>
      <dd>
        A general-purpose computer is a versatile machine that can perform a
        wide range of tasks and applications. They can be programmed to execute
        different software programs, handle different data types, and perform
        different operations. They can also be adapted to many uses by simply
        changing their program.
      </dd>
      <dt id="FinancialAccountingsoftware">
        <b>Financial Accounting Software</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>

        reporting every transaction of a business or an organization, in order
        to assess the financial health and stability of the same. There are a
